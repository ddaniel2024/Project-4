## Creating and optimising a Logistic Regression Model to analyse employee attrition

<em>attrition - the likelihood that an employee leaves employement, for whatever reason, voluntary or involuntary</em>

We used an employee attrition (from IBM) dataset with variety of metrics ranging from age, gender, to job involvement, salary, stock options etc., to create a logistic regression model to predict attrition.

We then attempted to optimise the model usin various techniques:
* Correlation Analysis
* Permutations
* RFE (Recursive Feature Elimination)
* Further pre-processing
* Comparing Model Coefficients

We comapred and contrasted each of these methods to identify what was most suitable for our model.
